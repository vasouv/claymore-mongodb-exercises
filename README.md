# Claymore MongoDB Exercises
In this project I want to use MongoDB commands to query the collection. There will be a init script that reverts the database in a starting version, so if any command is destructive there will be a script to start over. Also, the final script with the final structure of the database will be present.

For more information about the characters and data used here, take a look at [Claymore Wiki](https://claymore.fandom.com/wiki/Claymore)
